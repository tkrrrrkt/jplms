# Research & Design Decisions Template

---
**Purpose**: Capture discovery findings, architectural investigations, and rationale that inform the technical design.

**Usage**:
- Log research activities and outcomes during discovery phase.
- Document design decision trade-offs too detailed for `design.md`.
- Provide references and evidence for future audits or reuse.
