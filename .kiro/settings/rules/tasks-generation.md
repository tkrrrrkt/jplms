# Task Generation Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Natural Language Descriptions
Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure.

**Describe**:
- What functionality to achieve
- Business logic and behavior
- Features and capabilities
- Domain language and concepts
- Data relationships and workflows

**Avoid**:
- File paths and directory structure
- Function/method names and signatures
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Class names and API contracts

**Rationale**: Implementation details are defined in design.md. Tasks describe the functional work to be done.

### 2. Task Integration & Progression

**Every task must**:
- Build on previous outputs (no orphaned code)
- Connect to the overall system (no hanging features)
- Progress incrementally (no big jumps in complexity)
- Validate core functionality early in sequence
- Respect architecture boundaries defined in design.md

**End with integration tasks** to wire everything together.

### 3. Flexible Task Sizing

**Guidelines**:
- **Major tasks**: As many sub-tasks as logically needed
- **Sub-tasks**: 1-3 hours each, 3-10 details per sub-task
- Balance between too granular and too broad

### 4. Requirements Mapping

**End each task detail section with**:
- `_Requirements: X.X, Y.Y_` listing **only numeric requirement IDs** (comma-separated)
- For cross-cutting requirements, list every relevant requirement ID
- All requirements MUST have numeric IDs in requirements.md

### 5. Code-Only Focus

**Include ONLY**:
- Coding tasks (implementation)
- Testing tasks (unit, integration, E2E)
- Technical setup tasks (infrastructure, configuration)

**Exclude**:
- Deployment tasks
- Documentation tasks
- User testing
- Marketing/business activities

### Optional Test Coverage Tasks

- Mark purely test-oriented follow-up work as optional using `- [ ]*` checkbox
- Never mark implementation work as optional

## Task Hierarchy Rules

### Maximum 2 Levels
- **Level 1**: Major tasks (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- **Level 2**: Sub-tasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2...)
- **No deeper nesting** (no 1.1.1)
- If a major task would contain only a single item, promote the sub-task to major level

### Sequential Numbering
- Major tasks MUST increment: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Sub-tasks reset per major task: 1.1, 1.2, then 2.1, 2.2...
- Never repeat major task numbers

### Parallel Analysis (default)
- Identify tasks that can run concurrently when **all** conditions hold:
  - No data dependency on other pending tasks
  - No shared file or resource contention
  - No prerequisite review/approval from another task
- Append `(P)` for parallel-capable tasks
- If sequential mode requested, omit `(P)` markers

### Checkbox Format
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Major task description
- [ ] 1.1 Sub-task description
  - Detail item 1
  - Detail item 2
  - _Requirements: X.X_

- [ ] 2. Next major task (NOT 1 again!)
- [ ] 2.1 Sub-task...
```

## Requirements Coverage

**Mandatory Check**:
- ALL requirements from requirements.md MUST be covered
- Cross-reference every requirement ID with task mappings
- If gaps found: Return to requirements or design phase
- No requirement should be left without corresponding tasks
